# pi-hole blacklist.txt
My personal `blacklist.txt` for [pi-hole](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/). Updates (if any) wil be pushed weekly automatically.

**NOTE: For the privacy paranoia only**

It blocks not only additional trackers, also [content delivery networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) and mainstream social media companies such as WhatsApp, Google, Pinterest, Youtube, Instagram, etc.
